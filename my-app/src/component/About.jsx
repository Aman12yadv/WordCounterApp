      <h3>How a Company Works</h3>
      <h5>A company is essentially an artificial person—also known as corporate personhood—in that it is an entity separate from the individuals who own, manage, and support its operations. Companies are generally organized to earn a profit from business activities, though some may be structured as nonprofit charities. Each country has its own hierarchy of company and corporate structures, though with many similarities.

A company has many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as a person does, like the ability to enter into contracts, the right to sue (or be sued), borrow money, pay taxes, own assets, and hire employees.</h5>
